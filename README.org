* Brand I

BrandI manages my online presence as if I was a brand.

That constitutes helping me with:

1. Public perception

   - Presenting myself in a way which highlights the qualities I want to
     showcase
   - Managing the exposure-surface
     - Provide awareness of different websites where I expose myself to public
       view
     - Manage what kind of content I am associating myself with through
       different online platforms

2. Market research

   Staying updated with where rest of the world is going

   - Following people on the internet
   - Maintaining an evolving reading-list, and actually reading it

3. Self awareness

   - Identifying the aspects I want to grow
   - Keeping track of the progress I make

This mostly boils down to having an application which:

1. Is an RSS reader to follow blogs, social media and other content I want to
   follow (like Github activity)
2. Is a dashboard of my personal goals
3. Is a "Profile editor" which allow me to see and change my "profile" on
   different online platforms from a single place

Or that's what I think it is going to be. Let's see where it goes :-)
